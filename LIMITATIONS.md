# Model Limitations

My model has some real problems I noticed. The biggest issue is I only trained it on 200 fake examples, so it doesn't work well with different types of reviews. It apologizes way too much, even when people say positive things. Sometimes it writes really long responses to short reviews and short responses to long reviews, which looks weird. Since I made up all the training data myself, the model doesn't understand how real customers actually talk with typos or slang. I only tested it with English reviews under 200 characters. It probably can't detect sarcasm or mixed feelings either. This was just for a school assignment, so don't use it for a real business.
