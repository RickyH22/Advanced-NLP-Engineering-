# Model Limitations

This fine-tuned model has several important limitations. First, it was trained on only 200 examples, which is quite small and limits its ability to generalize to diverse review types. The model sometimes over-apologizes for neutral or positive reviews, showing it hasn't fully learned sentiment nuances. Response length is inconsistent - brief reviews sometimes get lengthy responses while detailed reviews get short replies. The training data was synthetic and doesn't capture real customer language patterns, slang, or spelling errors. Additionally, the model wasn't tested on multiple languages, special characters, or extremely long reviews beyond 200 characters. It may not handle edge cases like sarcasm, mixed sentiment, or product-specific technical questions. Finally, this is a demonstration model not suitable for production use without significantly more training data and evaluation.
